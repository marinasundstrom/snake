# Snake

Implementation of the classic game: Snake.

There are some bugs and cases that are not handled.

## Rules

When the snake encounters a snack it will grow in length, and the snack count will increase.

When the snake is running into itself the game is reset and the count also.

When the snake goes outside the playing field it emerges on the opposite side.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* HTML, Canvas

## Background

This project was actually inspired from a colleague of mine who had been building a snake game while being sick. 

I re-implemented his algorithm and used Canvas instead.

## Why?

Because I saw it as a fun exercise. :)
